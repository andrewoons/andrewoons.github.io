### Bio

I love creating products that have a positive impact on people's personal or professional lives. I spend my days trying to achieve just that. I run on coffee :)

I am co-founder and CTO at [Nivoda](https://nivoda.net), which is the fastest, easiest and most profitable way to buy and sell diamonds.

Prior to that, I was on a mission to make value transfer more personal and efficient with Florin. I started programming at age 14 and started my first business at age 15, having completed over 50 freelance projects.
