### Bio

I love creating products that have a positive impact on people's lives. I spend my days trying to achieve just that. I run on coffee :)

Started programming at 14, started my first business at 15. I have completed over 50 freelance projects, was on a mission to make value transfer more personal and efficient with Florin and am now on a mission to change the diamond &amp; jewellery industry through Nivoda.
